This project is a 15-day Data Science internship with Codveda Technology, a company specializing in IT solutions like AI/ML automation and data analysis. The core of the internship is to complete a set of practical data science tasks to build and demonstrate your skills.


Task Breakdown by Level üìù
The tasks are divided into three difficulty levels, covering the entire data science workflow from data collection to advanced modeling.

Level 1 (Basic)
This level focuses on foundational data handling and analysis skills.


Task 1: Data Collection and Web Scraping: Involves using Python tools like BeautifulSoup and requests to extract data from a website and save it in a structured format like CSV or JSON.





Task 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Focuses on preparing a raw dataset for analysis by handling missing data, removing outliers, and encoding variables.



Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Requires you to analyze data to find trends and insights by calculating summary statistics and creating visualizations like histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices.



Level 2 (Intermediate)
This level moves into building and evaluating predictive models.


Task 1: Predictive Modeling (Regression): You'll build a model to predict a continuous value (e.g., house prices) using algorithms like Linear Regression or Random Forest and evaluate its performance with metrics like MSE and R-squared.





Task 2: Classification: The goal is to build a model that predicts a categorical outcome (e.g., flower species) using Logistic Regression and evaluate it with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.



Task 3: Clustering (Unsupervised Learning): Involves using the K-Means algorithm to group unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation) and using methods like the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.


Level 3 (Advanced)
This level covers specialized and more complex data science topics.


Task 1: Time Series Analysis: You will analyze time-stamped data to forecast future values (e.g., stock prices) by building models like ARIMA or SARIMA.


Task 2: Natural Language Processing (NLP): This task requires you to classify text (e.g., spam vs. non-spam). It involves preprocessing text data and training a model like Naive Bayes.



Task 3: Neural Networks with TensorFlow/Keras: You'll build, train, and evaluate a simple neural network for a classification task, such as identifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
